# hb21
Webscraping National Institute of Standards and Technology for thermophysical properties of rocket related fluids and generating a pressure volume diagram. Code was left to be versatile in case I want to look into other fluids and their properties across different states. I probably could have looked for / downloaded the data but doing it this way allows me to just put in a fluid and get the information I want without having to search for it.
Next steps for this project are temperature and pressure sensor input to then physically locate where the state is on the diagram.
